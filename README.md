This repository contains notebooks where I explore a variety of structured datasets using statistical analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling techniques. The goal is to evaluate model performance across different algorithms by analyzing metrics like R^2, RMSE, and residual distributions. Each notebook includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), and preprocessing steps to uncover meaningful insights.
