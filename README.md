This repository contains notebooks where I explore a variety of structured datasets using statistical analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling techniques. The goal is to evaluate model performance across different algorithms by analyzing metrics like R-squarred, RMSE, residual distributions, and other metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1). Each notebook includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), and preprocessing steps to uncover meaningful insights.
