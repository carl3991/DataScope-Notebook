# Used Car Market Analysis
These two projects explore pricing trends in the used car market using regression and decision tree models.
Both projects analyze used car markets but **with different datasets and business questions**. Both focus on dealership listings to predict prices. However, the other classifies car age groups to explore broader market trends. Having both demonstrates adaptability across datasets and consistency in applying regression and machine learning methods.


## Goals
- Predict used car prices based on structured data
- Transforming `year` into `car_age` significantly improved model performance.
- Compare multiple regression techniques: Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression for the best fit

##  Key Findings
- Both projects suggested that `car_age` and `mileage` features are the dominant predictors for predicting used car prices
- Random Forest Regressor and Classifier delivered the most balanced results in predicting car price and inn classifying young vs old cars
- Residuals from both models showed near-normal distribution, indicating strong generalization
