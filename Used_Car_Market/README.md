# Used Car Market Analysis

This project explores pricing trends in the used car market using regression and decision tree models, and feature engineering. After analyzing key features, transforming `year` into `car_age` significantly improved model performance.

## Goals
- Predict used car prices based on structured data
- Apply feature engineering to improve model accuracy
- Compare multiple regression techniques: Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression for the best fit

##  Key Findings
- `car_age` feature is highly correlated with price and improves model performance
- Random Forest delivered the most balanced results with an R^2 of 0.90 and low residual bias
- Residuals from both models showed near-normal distribution, indicating strong generalization
