## Objectives
This project explores a small dataset of 237 laptops to understand how specifications drive pricing. Through exploratory analysis and feature engineering, I highlight the strongest predictors of price and demonstrate regression models as proof of concept. The project illustrates how even limited data can yield actionable insights when approached thoughtfully.
